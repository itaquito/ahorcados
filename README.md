# Ahorcados (Hangman game)

This was my first ever Python app. It won the first place at a contest in the Universidad Panamericana. 

## Important notes
- This app was created using a Jupyter Notebook. However, you can run it with other apps that support notebooks (such as VScode).
- This app was made in spanish. Mainly because the contest was all in spanish. However, it should be fairly easy to translate.
- This app creates a leaderboard file at the first run. This is where the leaderboards are saved. 

## Installing dependencies
- If you want to use the voice synthesizer, you need to install some dependencies: `pip install gTTS pyttsx3 playsound`.


Enjoy!
